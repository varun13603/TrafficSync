# Density-Based-Traffic-Control-System-Using-Machine-learning
Designed and implemented a real-time traffic control system that optimizes traffic flow. Leveraging live CCTV footage and AI-powered vehicle detection, the system dynamically adjusts green signal timings based on calculated traffic density. This intelligent approach minimizes congestion and waiting times at intersections.
